# **Life-Satisfaction-Prediction**
Life Satisfaction Index can be predicted by using GDP per capita as the features. This ML project was wrapped with streamlit and deployed on heroku.

**Note:** It's important for data scientist or ML practioners to be able to deploy their model.

## Simple Linear Model


life_satisfaction = &theta;<sub>o</sub> + &theta;<sub>1</sub> * GDP_percapita

where &theta;<sub>o</sub> and &theta;<sub>1</sub> are model features.
